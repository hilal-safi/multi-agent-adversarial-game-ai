# Multi-Agent Adversarial Game (Connect 4) with Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning & Gemini API

This project implements a multi-agent adversarial game environment using **Connect4** as the base game. It explores decision-making strategies using **Minimax**, **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, and a third-party AI agent via the **Gemini API**.
